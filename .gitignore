# Data files (IMPORTANT for financial data and sensitive info)
# DO NOT commit raw data, especially large files or sensitive financial data.
# You'll likely download or obtain the FNSPID data separately.
# Add patterns for your specific data files here.
# For example:
data/              # If you store raw data files in a 'data' folder
*.csv              # If you have raw CSVs
*.json
*.xlsx
*.db               # SQLite databases, etc.

# Results and Outputs
# You typically don't commit generated reports, plots, or model artifacts.

# Instead, use environment variables or a separate ignored config file.

*.env
